# SilentDragon Android - Android frontend for SilentDragon

SilentDragon Android is an Android frontend for the desktop SilentDragon that lets you send and receive shielded payments from your mobile phone.


## Google Play

SOON

## Dev Download

You can also head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonAndroid/releases) to download an APK.

### Run SilentDragon

In order to let your Android phone connect to your desktop, you need to run the deskop [SilentDragon](https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon), and sync a full zcash node.
Thankfully this should only take a few minutes with a fast internet connection! As the Hush network grows, it will take longer.

After your node is synced, go to `Apps -> Connect Mobile App` to view the connection QR Code, which you can scan from the Android App.

### Install the Android APK directly

If you're installing the APK directly, you'll need to allow `Install from untrusted sources` on your Android phone.

### Bugs???

You can file issues in the [issues tab](https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonAndroid/issues).
